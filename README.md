## Setup

If you are running windows, the easiest way to build this solution is through Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. You will also need .NET 8.0 installed.

1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone "https://github.com/Syntrice/syntrice-record-shop"
```

2. Navigate to repository root

```powershell
cd "./syntrice-contact-manager"
```

3. Restore dependencies

```powershell
dotnet restore
```

4. Build Project

```powershell
dotnet build "./ContactManager.sln"
```

As part of this process, you will also need to configure a sql server connection string. 
This can point to a locally installed SQL Server service, or any other location. 
You will need to apply a migration to this database to ensure that it is created.
Instructions on how to do this are coming soon!
